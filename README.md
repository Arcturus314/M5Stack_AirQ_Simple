# M5Stack_AirQ_Simple

This is derived from M5Stack's official demo application, but omits most of the fancy graphics and the uploading of data to their platform.

It is designed to be used with three Neopixel-compatible LEDs (for example, the M5Stack SK6812 RGB LED Unit). It will use these LEDs to display gas sensor status. The button marked with an arrow (G8) on the AirQ unit can be held to access a maximum sensor reading and battery status page.
